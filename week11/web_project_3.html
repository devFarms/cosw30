<p>Using your most recent files for List a Department and Add a Department (copy these files to a new directory for lab5 before editing), build out an EDIT and DELETE department function. Follow along with my video demonstrations below.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can choose whether you want to build these functions within one PHP page that will allow for adding a new record AND editing an existing record or if you want to have two separate PHP pages for these tasks.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Don't actually DELETE the record from the table, create a status flag that shows whether the department is A (active) or I (inactive). The best way to do this is to use a drop down select box.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>For this activity, you do not have to do anything to the USER table -- that will be coming next week.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Basic CRUD Update Demo- List Departments Modifications</strong></h3>
<p>In this first video, I walk through the logic behind the modifications to our list_departments.php page, including adding the status field to the DEPARTMENT table, showing the status in the output, and creating the edit hyperlink. You can see the <a href="http://34.94.95.169/homework/hw7/list_departments.php">demo of this code</a> and play around with the data.</p>

<h3><strong>Basic CRUD Update Demo - Update Code Process</strong></h3>
<p>This video is a bit longer (my apologies). I walk you through the process of building the update form and the update processing. Excuse the few bugs I ran into - I kept them in for you to see my process unfiltered!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Submit your website URL</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you have completed and thoroughly tested your code, submit your website URL for the list departments page. Ensure that from that page I will be able to test add/edit and delete.&nbsp;</p>
